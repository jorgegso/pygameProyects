Personal project done in Pygame, Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. Pygame adds functionality on top of the excellent SDL library. This allows you to create fully featured games and multimedia programs in the python language.

# Installation

$pip install pygame

You should definitely begin by installing a binary package for your system. The binary packages usually come with or give the information needed for dependencies. Choose an appropriate installer for your system and version of Python from the pygame downloads page. https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

Installing from source is fairly automated. The most work will involve compiling and installing all the pygame dependencies. Once that is done, run the "setup.py" script which will attempt to auto-configure, build, and install pygame.

Much more information about installing and compiling is available in the install.html file and at https://www.pygame.org/wiki/Compilation
